// SELF-CHECK PROBLEMS:
// Note: you will need to put some of your answers inside a comments
//
// Turn a line into a comment by putting // at the start of the line, like we're
// doing here
//
// You can comment a lot of lines at once in VSCode by
// highlighting the lines and then pressing Control/Command-/
// (or press Control/Command-P to bring up the Command Pallete and look for the
// 'Toggle Line Comment' command)
//
// For future lessons these notes (about how to write comments) will be left out
// Put your answer for #26 here:
// write down your answer here:
//I am method 1.
//I am method 1.
//I am method 2.
//I am method 3.
//I am method 1.
//I am method 1.
//I am method 2.
//I am method 1.
//I am method 2.
//I am method 3.
//I am method 1.

//I am method 2.
//I am method 3.
//I am method 1.
//I am method 1.
